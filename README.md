# -Serverless-Project-with-AWS
Exploring AWS serverless computing: Build RESTful APIs using AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and API Gateway for state machine orchestration and hashing operations.

## Introduction
This repository contains my individual assignment that demonstrates proficiency in serverless computing with AWS. The project involves creating a finite state machine using AWS Step Functions and Lambda functions, and building RESTful APIs with AWS API Gateway.

## Learning Outcomes
- Implement a finite state machine using AWS Step Functions and Lambda functions.
- Learn how to use AWS API Gateway to create serverless APIs.
- Gain insights into the benefits of serverless computing.

## Requirements
I have built REST API entry points using AWS serverless compute mechanisms. The application utilizes a State Machine, configured with API Gateway, to evaluate choices based on input and invoke Lambda functions to perform hashing operations on provided input data.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Configure your AWS credentials: Follow [AWS CLI Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
3. Set up your State Machine using Step Functions.
4. Create and configure Lambda functions for state transitions and hashing.
5. Set up API Gateway to handle RESTful endpoints.

### Usage
- Provide the appropriate endpoint URLs for communication with my app.
- Ensure that your State Machine, Lambda functions, and API Gateway are properly configured.
- Test the communication flow between the applications using POST requests.

## Notes
- Any external code used has been cited and appropriately modified.
- Pay close attention to AWS configurations to avoid debugging issues later.
- For further assistance, refer to the provided tutorials and AWS documentation.
